**Flashcards** is a feedback mechanism which attempts to optimize rote learning.  It's good for drilling Chinese characters on long Beijing subway rides, among other things.

The basic idea is that your memory of a symbol is subject to [exponential decay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay).  The longer you go without refreshing your memory of the symbol, the more it fades, and the greater the risk that you will forget whatever it is you associate with that symbol.  I came to feel it's an exponential decay while drilling characters with traditional paper flashcards, as I found myself constantly organizing the cards into sets to be tried again after one day, two days, four days, etc.  Flashcards attempts to automate this process and to minimize the decay of a set of symbols, or cards, you are attempting to learn by taking into account your history of trials at seeing each card and attempting to recall the information you have associated with it.

A graphical Flashcards interface is included in [Extendo-Android](https://github.com/joshsh/extendo-android).
